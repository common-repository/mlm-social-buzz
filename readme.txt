All the share buttons you as a network marketing blogger needs to generate social buzz, recognition and traffic!

== Description ==

With MLM Social Buzz, you have all your essential social sharing buttons in one place with a plugin exclusively created for network marketing and home business bloggers. When visitors to your blog click on the 'beat' button, it counts as a vote.

The more votes your blog posts get, the higher your posts get ranked on the front page of thatMLMbeat (similar functionality and layout to the old Digg) 

All top stories that get displayed on thatMLMbeat's front page plus selected posts of the day get featured in our daily newsletter.

We developed the plugin with your best interest at heart by making sure that your blog visitors remain on your blog.

Here are 3 possible scenarios that may happen when your blog visitors click on the 'beat' button:
1. They have an account with thatMLMbeat.com and are logged in
   If so, a small popup will appear stating that your blog vote has been posted.

2. They have an account with thatMLMbeat.com and are not logged in
   A lightbox popup (with shadow) will appear with a login screen, keeping your visitors on your blog. Once they log in, the vote will be posted.

3. They don't have an account with thatMLMbeat.com
   The popup will appear and they can click on the register link to register a free social profile.
